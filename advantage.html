    <h2>advantage of computer vision</h2>
  <h3>  a)  Improve Accuracy</h3> 
    <br>
                                                                                                                                                             One of the major advantages of computer vision is that it can be more accurate than human vision. The human brain is so amazing that it can complete images based on just a few pieces of information. It can sometimes also prevent us from seeing what is actually there.

   <h3>  b)  Deliver Faster Results</h3>
    <br>
                                                                                                                                                                     the brain works fast and efficiently, but computers are better at multitasking, which can allow them to deliver faster results for some applications. Computers can alsobe dedicated to performing specific tasks for long periods of time.

<br><h3> d) Provide Unbiased Results</h3> <br>
When a computer looks at an image with a specific goal, the irrelevant information is not taken into account.
e)   Offer a Unique Customer Experience
Computer vision has been used to enhance the customer experience both online and in retail stores.
 Online, it can be used to identify products or brands that an individual is most likely to buy based on
  images in social media profiles.
