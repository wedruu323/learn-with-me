    <h2>disadventage of computer vision</h2>
    One of the most controversial aspects of computer vision is the potential for invasion of privacy. Facial recognition software is a particularly contentious issue, especially for people who are concerned about invasion of privacy through surveillance either online or in the real world. Many people consider having the ability to move freely or search the internet privately to be basic rights that computer vision could infringe upon.
 By contrast, some argue that computer vision improves convenience and makes people feel more secure. Of course, there are trade-offs with any type of new technology, and the balance with computer vision continues to evolve. To be effective, computer vision models must also be trained. This can be challenging if you don’t have an in- house data scientist or the right platform to guide you through the process. Fortunately, with Skyl.ai, you don’t need to be a data scientist to create a computer vision model that meets your needs.

When used ethically, computer vision’s advantages far outweigh its potential disadvantages. Whether you’re using it to 
improve your e-commerce website or to save lives through faster diagnosis, computer vision provides many benefits. 
Although it might seem like futuristic technology, the reality is that you probably interact with some form of computer vision every day.
