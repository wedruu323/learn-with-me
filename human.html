        <h2>human computer relation</h2>
        Computer vision systems have become so high-performing, that comparisons to human performance have been made. It is in particular for identification tasks, for which computers have started to outperform human identification accuracy, such as face identification or hand-written digit identification. It must be added however, that if a human was trained solely on those tasks - without any other earthly distractions - , then a human may well be able to surpass those systems. What the human visual system (HVS) excels at are four aspects:
      <h3>  Massive Storage</h3>: the HVS is able to memorize a sheer amount of image material - think about your lifetime’s experiences.
      <h3> Effortless Categorization</h3>: the HVS is able to use that memory in a way to classify images within 150 milliseconds; think of how effortlessly you watch rapid-paced television commercials or pop-culture music videos.
       <h3> Efficient Search</h3>: when we search for a venue during driving, we are able to browse vast image material in extremely short time.
         <h3> Energy Efficiency (at Application Time)</h3>: after the HVS has acquired its representations throughout years of learning, it is extremely efficient at applying its system: guiding through traffic is carried out at computational costs that are orders of magnitude smaller than that of the computational hardware built into autonomous vehicles.
  In short, the HVS shows an unbeatable efficiency and flexibility that has not been achieved yet by any computer vision system, not even in its approach.
           <br>  5 Related field <br>
 Several fields are related to Computer Vision, two of which are closely related, namely Image Processing and Machine Vision; in fact, those two fields overlap with Computer Vision to such an extent, that their names are sometimes used synonymously. Here is an attempt to discriminate between them, although there exist no agreed definitions and distinctions: 
 Image Processing is concerned with the transformation or other manipulation of the image with the goal to emphasize certain image aspects, e.g. contrast enhancement, or extraction of low-level features such as edges, blobs, etc; in comparison, Computer Vision is rather concerned with higher-level feature extraction and their interpretation for recognition purposes. 
 Machine Vision is concerned with applying a range of technologies and methods to provide imaging-based automatic inspection, process control and robot guidance in industrial applications. A machine-vision system has typically 3 characteristics: 
          1) objects are seen against a uniform background, which represents a ’controlled situation’. 
         2) objects possess limited structural variability, sometimes only one object needs to be identified.
         3) the exact orientation in 3D is of interest. 
          An example is car license plate detection and reading at toll gates, which is a relatively controlled situation. In comparison, computer vision systems often deal with objects of larger variability and objects that are situated in varying backgrounds. Car license plate detection in Google Street View is an example of an object with limited variability but varying context. There exist two other fields that overlap with Computer Vision. 
           Pattern Recognition (Machine Learning) is the art of classification (or categorization). To build a good computer vision system, it requires substantial knowledge of classification methodology. Sometimes it is even the more significant part of the computer-vision system, as in case of image classification, for which so-called Deep Neural Networks have produced the best classification accuracy.
          Computer Graphics is sometimes considered as part of Computer Vision. The objective in Computer Graphics is to represent objects and scenes as compactly and efficiently as possible; however there is no (semantic) recognition of any kind involved.
