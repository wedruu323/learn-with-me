        <h2> <br> related to Computer Vision</h2> <br>, two of which are closely related, namely Image Processing and Machine Several Vision; in fact, those two fields overlap with Computer Vision to such an extent, that their names are sometimes used synonymously. Here is an attempt to discriminate between them, although there exist no agreed definitions and distinctions: 
        Image Processing is concerned with the transformation or other manipulation of the image with the goal to emphasize certain image aspects, e.g. contrast enhancement, or extraction of low-level features such as edges, blobs, etc; in comparison, Computer Vision is rather concerned with higher-level feature extraction and their interpretation for recognition purposes. 
        Machine Vision is concerned with applying a range of technologies and methods to provide imaging-based automatic inspection, process control and robot guidance in industrial applications. A machine-vision system has typically 3 characteristics: 
               <br>  1) objects are seen against a uniform background, which represents a ’controlled situation’. <br>
               <br>
                2) objects possess limited structural variability, sometimes only one object needs to be identified. <br>
                <br>
                3) the exact orientation in 3D is of interest. <br>
                <br>
                 An example is car license plate detection and reading at toll gates, which is a relatively controlled situation. In comparison, computer vision systems often deal with objects of larger variability and objects that are situated in varying backgrounds. Car license plate detection in Google Street View is an example of an object with limited variability but varying context. There exist two other fields that overlap with Computer Vision. 
                  Pattern Recognition (Machine Learning) is the art of classification (or categorization). <br>
                  <br>
                  To build a good computer vision system, it requires substantial knowledge of classification methodology. Sometimes it is even the more significant part of the computer-vision system, as in case of image classification, for which so-called Deep Neural Networks have produced the best classification accuracy.
                 Computer Graphics is sometimes considered as part of Computer Vision. The objective in Computer Graphics is to represent objects and scenes as compactly and efficiently as possible; however there is no (semantic) recognition of any kind involved
