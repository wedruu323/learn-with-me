<h2>prehistory of computer vision</h2>
    Computer Vision was originally founded as a sub-discipline of the field of Artificial Intelligence in the 1970s.
     The founding goal was to create a system that has the same perceptual capabilities as the human visual system has -
      your eyes and most of your brain. <br> 
     <br> The human visual system can easily interpret any scene with little effort: 
      it perfectly discriminates between thousands of categories, and it can find objects in scenes within a time span of
       several hundred milliseconds only; it easily switches between several types of recognition processes with a 
       flexibility and swiftness, whose complexity and dynamics have not been well understood yet. It quickly turned out,
        that that goal was rather ambitious.

<br> •	1966: Minsky assigns computer vision as an undergrad summer project <br>
<br> •	1960’s: interpretation of synthetic worldsbr <br>
<br> •	1970’s: some progress on interpreting selected images <br>
<br> •	1980’s: ANNs come and go; shift toward geometry and increased mathematical rigor <br>
<br> •	1990’s: face recognition; statistical analysis in vogue <br>
<br> •	2000’s: broader recognition; large annotated datasets available; video processing starts <br>
